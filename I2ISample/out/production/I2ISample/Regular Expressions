Penguins live in Antarctica and they are unable to use Latin alphabet or numbers. However, they are able to write strings of symbols # and @.
Write regular expressions for:
(a) string that contain at least one #.
(b) string that have exactly two @'s and exactly two #'s.
(c) string that end with @@ or ##.
(d) string that contain at least two @'s or exactly two #'s.

My Solutions:
(a) (@|#)*#(@|#)*
(b)  @@## | @#@# | @##@ | ##@@ | #@#@ | #@@#
(c) (@|#)*(@@|##)
(d) (@|#)*@@((@|#)*) | @*#@*#@*
